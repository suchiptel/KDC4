<h1>Love for Animals</h1>
<p>On Sundays or holidays, Shantilal used to go to pastures on the banks of the River Vishvamitri to graze livestock. At home, the family owned two buffaloes and a pair of oxen. After finishing lunch around 11am, he would leave with his friends and take around half an hour to reach the pastures, where the cows and buffaloes would graze. At that time, some of the children would even ride on the cows and buffaloes for fun. In the afternoon, these cattle would also take a dip in the river, with some of the boys sitting on them. Shantilal, however, never participated in this. If there happened to be a lot of water in the river, Shantilal would reach the opposite shore by holding on to a tail, rarely ever sitting on an animal. The mere thought of sitting on a cow or buffalo and hitting it brought shudders to him. As per the saying: ‘Ātmavat sarva-bhuteshu yah pashyati sa pashyati...’ – One should feel the sentiments of all living beings as one’s own. </p>
